This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Debug and Release APK
# Debug APK
# How to generate one in 3 steps?
Step 1: Go to the root of the project in the terminal and run the below command:<br />
```bash
react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```
Step 2: Go to android directory:<br />
```bash
cd android
```
Step 3: Now in this android folder, run this command<br />
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

There! you’ll find the apk file in the following path:< br/>
```bash
yourProject/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Screen Navigation

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

## 4 part of screen

Step 1. Import libraries to create componets.<br />
Step 2. Create a component that return some jsx / simple function.<br />
Step 3. Create a StyleSheet to style the component.<br />
Step 4. Export the file, so that we can use it elsewhere in our app.

## How to conver App.tsx to App.js

Step 1: Rename App.tsx file to App.js. <br />
Step 2: Delete tsconfig.json file. <br />
Step 3: Remove typescript library in package.json file.
type command on terminal
```bash
npm uninstall typescript
```

## Linear Gradient

```bash
npm i react-native-linear-gradient
```

## Create new project

```bash
npx react-native@latest init <Project_Name>
```

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
